# Livres - frontend

The steps to run the frontend:

Clone the project if you haven't

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Arelera/livres.git
```

Change directory to frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the project

Note that the frontend requires the baseUrl in `src/store/actions/books.js` to be set to `http://localhost:3001` and the backend to be running to display any data.
